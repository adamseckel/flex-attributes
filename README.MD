Flex Attributes
=============

This library allows you to compose layout with flexbox in html. Containers
are composed by combining fa-column|fa-row with fa-layout.

`fa-column` or `fa-row` sets the element to be a flex container and sets the direction, `fa-layout` defines how children align on the main, and secondary axis.
```fa-column="reverse nowrap" fa-layout="space-between baseline"```


`fa-layout` can be shorthanded to just the main axis
```fa-row fa-layout="space-between"```

Installation
------------

```
npm install flex-attributes
bower install flex-attributes
